  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 19, 2025</p>

  <p>GreenHealth Technologies operates the Work Regista mobile application (the “App”), a workers’ attendance tracking and management system. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use Work Regista. By using our App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When organizations subscribe to Work Regista, their staff may be required to create user accounts. During sign-up, we collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Facial capture (biometric data) for authentication and attendance verification</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>During clock-in and clock-out, the App requires GPS location and facial capture to confirm attendance and verify identity.</li>
    <li>Users may also exchange messages through the in-app chat feature, including the option to attach files when submitting leave applications or sharing information with colleagues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, cookies, or other tracking information.</p>

  <p>We use the information collected to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage staff accounts under subscribed organizations</li>
    <li>Authenticate users and verify identity through facial capture</li>
    <li>Track staff attendance using GPS and biometric confirmation</li>
    <li>Facilitate in-app communication and collaboration between colleagues</li>
    <li>Enable staff to submit leave applications and attach supporting files for organizational administrators</li>
    <li>Ensure secure and efficient workforce management for subscribing organizations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your personal information to any third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Sensitive Data: Facial Capture (Biometrics)</h2>
  <p>Facial capture is used only for identity verification during:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial account setup (sign-up)</li>
    <li>Daily clock-in and clock-out</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This biometric data is stored securely in Google Firebase and is not shared with any third party. It is used exclusively for the purposes of attendance management and identity verification.</p>

  <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
