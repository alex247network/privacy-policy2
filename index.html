Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 19, 2025

GreenHealth Technologies operates the Work Regista mobile application (the “App”), a workers’ attendance tracking and management system. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use Work Regista. By using our App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

Facial capture (biometric data) for authentication and attendance verification
Additionally:

During clock-in and clock-out, the App requires GPS location and facial capture to confirm attendance and verify identity.
Users may also exchange messages through the in-app chat feature, including the option to attach files when submitting leave applications or sharing information with colleagues.
We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, cookies, or other tracking information.

3. Sensitive Data: Facial Capture (Biometrics)
Facial capture is used only for identity verification during:

Initial account setup (sign-up)
Daily clock-in and clock-out
This biometric data is stored securely in Google Firebase and is not shared with any third party. It is used exclusively for the purposes of attendance management and identity verification.

4. Data Storage and Security
All data, including authentication, chat messages, file attachments, and biometric records, is securely stored and managed through Google Firebase services.

If you are an employee using Work Regista and would like your data removed, please contact your organization’s administrator.

6. Subscription and Payments
Work Regista is a subscription-based service. All payments are handled through external invoicing directly between subscribing organizations and GreenHealth Technologies. The App itself does not process or store payment information.
